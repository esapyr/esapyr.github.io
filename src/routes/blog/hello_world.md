This blog is a static site built with [Sveltekit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Each blog post is a markdown file that's rendered by [MDsveX](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/) and styled by [Tailwind Typography](https://tailwindcss-typography.vercel.app/); otherwise it's all just Svelte and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Publishing updates to the site just requires compiling the site with a [special adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-static) and pushing it to a branch on github that's configured to deploy on commit.
